# Civil Engineering & CAD LMS — Consolidated Specification (Full Capture)

This document captures **everything discussed from the start up to now**, consolidated into a single, authoritative reference for building a **world‑class, industry‑standard Online LMS for Civil Engineering, Construction Technology, CAD, BIM, and Structural Drafting**.

---

## 1) Vision & Goal

Build a **professional, intensive, globally competitive LMS** comparable in quality and depth to leading platforms (Canvas, edX, Coursera, Open edX), but **specialized for Civil Engineering and CAD training**.

Primary objectives:
- Practical, job‑ready civil engineering skills
- Strong CAD & BIM competence (AutoCAD, Civil 3D, Revit, ArchiCAD)
- Construction technology + site engineering mastery
- Clean, modern, responsive UI
- LMS‑ready architecture (static, vanilla HTML/CSS/JS)

---

## 2) Reference: Best LMS in the World (Benchmark)

Used as inspiration and quality benchmarks:
- **Canvas LMS** — best overall academic LMS
- **Moodle** — most popular open‑source LMS
- **Open edX** — enterprise‑grade open source (MIT/Harvard)
- **Coursera / edX** — content quality benchmark
- **Docebo / TalentLMS** — enterprise training UX

The goal LMS should **match or exceed** these in:
- Structure
- UX clarity
- Learning flow
- Professional appearance
